# Welcome to MarsMission!

This is a single-page martian themed to-do app, using React and Redux.

There are potential improvements to be made, but if you would like to have a look you can:

1. Fork and clone this Repository.

2. Open it locally and run:
``npm install``

3. run: ``npm start``

4. Make a list of tasks to complete!

I would like to apply a backend to this project eventually, so that the tasks are not lost.
I would also like to implement CSS media queries to make this project accessible on other sized screens.
